    INTRODUCTION TO JAVA                           
        What is Java?
                • Java is a high-level, robust, and object-oriented
                programming language that was initially developed by
                Sun Microsystems (now a subsidiary of Oracle) in 1995.
                • It follows the principle of WORA (Write Once Run
                Anywhere)
                – you can run a java program as many times as you want on a Java
                supported platform after it is compiled. There is no need for
                recompilation.
                • A platform is any hardware or software environment
                where you can run your programs. Java is known as a
                platform because it has a runtime environment (JRE) and
                API.
                • First ever usage of Java in an embedded system : Link
                History of Java
                • 1991: Java was first designed for the digital cable
                television industry
                • It was initially known as the Green Team. It was designed
                by James Gosling and his team members, Mike Sheridan
                and Patrick Naughton
                • Later it got renamed to Oak based on the Oaktree outside
                James Gosling‟s Office
                • 1995: Oak got changed to Java based on the island in
                Indonesia from which the team used to have coffee
                • Java was included in Time magazine‟s “Top Ten Best
                Product of 1995”
                • 1996: JDK 1.0 got released.

Introduction to OOP:
             The major motivating factor in the invention of object-oriented approach is to remove
            drawbacks of procedural oriented approach.
             OOP treats data as critical element in the program development and does not allow it
            freely to flow around the system or application or program.
             OOP combines the data and methods(functions) into a single unit this process is called
            encapsulation.
             The organisation of data and Methods(functions) in object-oriented programming is
            shown in the following diagram.
             OOP allows divide a problem into a no of entities called as objects and then build data
            and Methods(functions) around these objects.
             The data of an object can be accessed only by the method(function) associated with that
            object.
             In OOP, method(function) of one object can access the method(function) of other objects.
            Disadvantage of Conventional Programming:
             Traditional programming languages such as COBOL, FORTRAN, C etc. are commonly
            known as procedure-oriented languages and also called as Conventional Languages.
             The program written in these languages consists of a sequence of instructions that tells the
            compiler or interpreter to perform a given task.
             When a program code is large, it becomes inconvenient to manage and debug. To overcome
            this problem, it is divided into smaller functions the carryout some specific task.
             Each function can call another function during the execution.
             As the functions are executing, they may access same data, and modify the data which in
            turn effects the entire task.
             Most of the functions are allowed to access the global data.
            Disadvantages:
            1. Large programs are divided into smaller programs known as functions. These functions can
            call one another. Hence security is not provided.
            2. No importance is given to security of data and importance is given to doing things.
            3. Data move openly around the system from function to function.
            4. Most functions accesses global data, what happens to the data is not known.
            Basic Concepts (Key Concepts) / principles / features of Object-Oriented Programming:
            Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using
            classes and objects.
            It simplifies the software development and maintenance by providing some concepts like:
             Class
             Object
             Encapsulation & Data hiding
             Inheritance
             Polymorphism
             Abstraction
             Message Passing
            Class:
            Class is an abstract data type (user defined data type) / non-primitive data type that contains
            attributes and methods that operate on data. It starts with the keyword class.
            (or)
            Class is a blueprint or template for creating an object.
            e.g.: public class Student
            {
            String name;
            int id;
            public void readData()
            {
            }
            public void displayData ()
            {
            }
            };
            Object:
            An object is an instance of a class. It is a variable that represents attributes as well as methods
            required for operating on the data. They interact with private data and methods through public
            methods.
            (or)
            An object is an entity that exists physically in the real world which requires some memory will
            be called as an object.
            An object consists of:
            State: It is represented by attributes / properties of an object.
            Behaviour: It is represented by actions / methods of an object.
            e.g.: Student s1 = new Student ();
             Student s2 = new Student ();
            In the above example Student is the class name and s1 and s2 are objects of that class.
            e.g.: Class Object
            Fruit Apple, Banana, Grape
            Animal Lion, Tiger, Elephant
            Mobile Apple, Samsung, Redmi, Realme
            Laptop Dell, HP, Lenovo, Mi
            Encapsulation & Data hiding:
            Encapsulation:
            Encapsulation is the process of combining data and methods into a single unit is called as
            encapsulation.
            Data Hiding:
            Data hiding means hiding the internal data within the class to prevent its direct access from
            outside the class. It is achieved by using an access modifier - a private modifier.
            i.e., Private data and methods are available to the public methods only. They cannot be accessed
            by the other part of the program. This process of hiding private data and methods from the other
            part of the program is called as data hiding
            Note: The recommended modifier for data members is private. The main advantage of data
            hiding is security
            Example 1: capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.
            Example 2:
            class Account {
            private double account_balance;
            ……..
            …….
            }
            Inheritance:
             It is a process of using the properties of one class inside other class is known as inheritance.
             The main aim of Inheritance is Reusability of the data and methods i.e. data and methods
            declared in one class can be accessed by other class.
             In Inheritance, two classes are involved (super class/base class/parent class and sub
            class/derived class/child class).
             The class which gives the properties is called as super class / base class / parent class.
             The class which takes the properties and methods is called as sub-class/derived class /child
            class.
            Reusability: Using the already existing code is called as reusability. This is mostly used in
            inheritance. The already existing code is inherited to the new class. It saves a lot of time and
            effort. It also reduces the size of the program.
            Polymorphism:
            The word polymorphism is derived from two latin words poly(many) and morph (forms).
            Polymorphism means the ability to take many forms. Polymorphism allows to take different
            implementations for same name.
            Poly -> many
            Morph -> forms
            ism -> behaviours
            There are two types of polymorphism, Compile time polymorphism and Run time
            polymorphism.
            In Compile time polymorphism binding is done at compile time and in runtime polymorphism
            binding is done at runtime.
            e.g.: Method Overloading and Method Overriding
            Method Overloading:
             Method overloading is used for compile time polymorphism.
             Same method name having different implementations with different number and type of
            arguments.
            Method Overriding:
             Method overriding is used for runtime polymorphism
            Base Class
            Derived Class OOP Through Java
             Method overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of a method which is
            already provided by its superclass.
            e.g.: mouseClick()
            Close button -> Window gets closed
            Max button -> window gets maximised
            Min button -> window gets minimized
            Abstraction:
            It is a process of Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction.
            For example: Phone call, we don't know the internal processing.
            Message Passing:
            An object-oriented program contains a set of objects that communicate with one another. The
            process of object-oriented programming contains the basic steps:
            1. Creating classes
            2. Creating objects
            3. Establishing communication among objects
            This communication is done with the help of methods (i.e., passing objects to methods)
            Objects communicate with one another by sending and receiving information much the same
            way as people pass messages to one another.
            Message passing involves specifying the name of object, the name of the method (message) and
            the information to be sent.
            Example:
            Advantages of OOP:
            Object oriented technology provides many advantages to the programmer and the user. This
            technology solves many problems related to software development, provides improved quality
            and low-cost software.
            1. Object oriented programs can be comfortably upgraded.
            2. Using inheritance, we can eliminate redundant program code and reuse already existing
            code.
            3. Data hiding facilitates the programmer to design and develop safe programs.
            4. Through polymorphism, it provides the extensibility of the code.
            5. With OOP, programs are easy to understand.
            6. With OOP, programs are easier to test, manage and maintain.
            7. Objects can communicate with each other by message passing mechanism.
            Applications of OOP:
            The promising areas for application of OOP includes:
            1. Real-time systems
            2. Simulation and modelling
            3. Object-oriented databases
            4. Hypertext, hypermedia and expert text
            5. AI and expert systems
            6. Neural networks and parallel programming
            7. Decision support and Automation system
            8. CIM/CAM/CAD systems
            History of java:
            1. Java is an Object-Oriented Programming language, High level, Case Sensitive and
            General purpose programming language.
            2. JAVA was developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems Inc in the
            year 1991, later acquired by Oracle Corporation.
            3. James Gosling is known as the father of Java.
            4. Before Java, it was called Oak and was developed as a part of the Green project. Since
            Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name
            from Oak to Java In 1995.
            5. Java is an island in Indonesia where the first coffee was produced (called Java coffee).
            Java name was chosen by James Gosling while having a cup of coffee nearby his office.
            6. Java is just a name, not an acronym.

Features (Buzzwords) of Java:  
        1. Simple: Java is one of the simple languages as it does not have complex features like
    pointers, operator overloading, multiple inheritances, and explicit memory allocation.
    2. Object-Oriented: Java Supports OOP features like Class, Object, Encapsulation and
    Data hiding, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Message Communication/ Message
    Passing.
    3. Portable: Java is portable because it facilitates you to carry the Java bytecode to any
    platform. It doesn't require any implementation.
    4. Platform independent: Java code can be executed on multiple platforms, for example,
    Windows, Linux, Sun Solaris, Mac/OS, etc. Java code is compiled by the compiler and
    converted into bytecode. This bytecode is a platform-independent code because it can be
    run on multiple platforms, i.e., Write Once and Run Anywhere (WORA).
    5. Secured: Java is best known for its security. With Java, we can develop virus-free
    systems. Java is secured because:
    No explicit pointer
    Java Programs run inside a virtual machine sandbox
    6. Robust: Java language is robust that means reliable.
    The main features of java that make it robust are garbage collection, Exception Handling,
    and memory allocation.
    7. Architecture neutral: Java is architecture neutral because there are no implementation
    dependent features, for example, the size of primitive types is fixed.In C programming, int data type occupies 2 bytes of memory for 16-bit architecture and 4
    bytes of memory for 32 and 64-bit architecture. However, it occupies 4 bytes of memory
    for both 32 and 64-bit architectures in Java.
    8. Compiled and Interpreted: Unlike other languages Java uses a system with both a
    compiler and an interpreter for program execution. First, the compiler converts the
    program code to bytecode which in turn is converted to machine code on any machine,
    using the interpreter. The machine code thus generated can be executed irrespective of
    the system on which it is being executed.
    9. High Performance: Java architecture is defined in such a way that it reduces overhead
    during the runtime and at some time java uses Just In Time (JIT) compiler where the
    compiler compiles code on-demand basics where it only compiles those methods that are
    called making applications to execute faster.
    10. Multithreaded: A thread is like a separate program, executing concurrently. We can
    write Java programs that deal with many tasks at once by defining multiple threads. The
    main advantage of multi-threading is that it doesn't occupy memory for each thread. It
    shares a common memory area. Threads are important for multi-media, Web
    applications, etc.
    11. Distributed: We can create distributed applications using the java programming
    language. Remote Method Invocation and Enterprise Java Beans are used for creating
    distributed applications in java. The java programs can be easily distributed on one or
    more systems that are connected to each other through an internet connection.
    12. Dynamic: Java being completely object-oriented gives us the flexibility to add classes,
    new methods to existing classes and even creating new classes through sub-classes. Java
    even supports functions written in other languages such as C, C++ which are referred to
    as native methods.
    Applications of Java:
    1. Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus, etc.
    2. Web Applications such as irctc.co.in.
    3. Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.
    4. Mobile
    5. Embedded System
    6. Smart Card
    7. Robotics                                                                                                                          Java Program Structure:
    A java program may contain one or more sections as shown in the figure.
    Documentation Section (Optional)
    
    1. This section comes first and it is also called as comments sections.
    2. Comments are non-executable statements in any programming language.
    3. Comments are used to write the program statement / program name.
    e.g. /* Write a C++ program illustrating Checking whether the number is even or odd
    using Ternary operator. */
    4. Comments are used to write the program log.
    e.g. /**Program Description : To check the no is even or odd
    Created Date : 28/10/2021
    Created Time : 10.00 am
    Created by : ABC
    Owner : XXX
     */
    5. Comments are used to write the remarks for each line in the program.
    6. Comments are 3 types in java
    1. Single line Comments:
    Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).
    Example: // This is a comment
    2. Multi line Comments:
    Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.
    Example: /* Write a C++ program illustrating Checking
     whether the number is even or odd
     using Ternary operator. */
    3. Documentation Comment: It starts with the delimiter (/) and ends with */.
    7. Whatever written in the documentation section is the comment and is not compiled by the
    compiler.
    8. Documentation Section is optional since the program can execute without them.
    Package statement (Optional)
    The first statement in a java file is a package statement. It declares a package name and inform
    the compiler that the classes define belong to the same package. This statement is optional.
    Package package_name:
    Package pkg1
    {
    …………………..
    }
    Package pkg2
    {
    ……………..
    }
    Import statement (optional)
    These are similar to # include statement in C or C++, this instructs the interpreter to load the
    method or class contained in the package.
    Interface statement (optional):
    RAGHU ENGINEERING COLLEGE (A) OOP Through Java
    18
    It is a class including a group of method declaration. It is used when multiple inheritances are
    implementing.
    Class definition
    Classes are defining to make the objects of real-world problem. The number of classes used
    depends on complexity of the program
    Main method class:
    It is the starting point and essential part of java programming while executing. It creates object of
    various classes and established a communication between them.
    Simple Java Program
    public class Demo {
    public static void main (String args[]) {
    System.out.println("Welcome to Java Class");
     }
    }
    Let us discuss the program line by line and understand the unique features that constitute a Java
    program.
    Class Declaration
    The first line class Demo, class is a keyword used to declare the class. As we know Java is a
    truly object-oriented language so everything must be placed inside a class. Demo is the identifier
    in java that defines the name of the class.
    Opening brace
    Every class definition in java begins with an opening brace “{” and ends with a matching closing
    brace “}”.
    The Main Line:
    public static void main (String args[])
    Every Java program must include the main() method. Java applets does not use main() method.
    This line contains a number of keywords public, static and void.
    Public:
    The keyword is an access modifier which represents visibility; it means it is accessible to all
    other classes. This is similar to C++ public modifier.
    Static:
    Statics a keyword, if we declare any method as static, it is treated as static method. The static
    method invoked without creating instance of a class. The main method is executed by the JVM,
    so it doesn't require creating an object to call the main method. So, it saves memory.
    void:
    void means nothing. It is the return type. main method use void as it does not return any value.
    String args[]:
    main method accept some data from user as command line argument in form of String and this
    can be achieved by String args[] array.
    Identifiers in Java:
    Identifiers in Java are symbolic names used for identification. They can be a class name, variable
    name, method name, package name, constant name, and more.
    Rules for Identifiers in Java
    If the identifiers are not properly declared, we may get a compile-time error. Following are some
    rules and conventions for declaring identifiers:
     A valid identifier must have characters [A-Z] or [a-z] or numbers [0-9], and underscore
    (_) or a dollar sign ($).
    For example, @sample is not a valid identifier because it contains a special character
    which is @.
     There should not be any space in an identifier.
    For example, Sample Program is an invalid identifier.
     An identifier should not contain a number at the starting.
    For example, 123Sample is an invalid identifier.
     An identifier should be of length 4-15 letters only. However, there is no limit on its
    length. But it is good to follow the standard conventions.
     We can't use the Java reserved keywords as an identifier such as int, float, double, char,
    etc.
    For example, int double is an invalid identifier in Java.
     An identifier should not be any query language keywords such as SELECT, FROM,
    COUNT, DELETE, etc
    Example:
    public class SampleProgram{
    public static void main (String args[]) {
    System.out.println("Welcome to Java Class");
     }
    }
    From the above example, we have the following Java identifiers:
    1. SampleProgram (Class name)
    2. main (User defined method)
    3. String (Predefined class name)
    4. args (String variables)
    5. System (Predefined class name)
    6. out (Instance name)
    7. println (Predefined method name)
    Valid identifiers:
     TestVariable
     testvariable
     a
     i
     Test_Variable
     _testvariable
     $testvariable
     sum_of_array
     TESTVARIABLE
     TEST123
     Javatest123
    Invalid identifiers:
    Naming Conventions
    Naming conventions specify the rules to be followed by a Java programmer while writing the
    names of packages, classes, methods etc.
    1. Package names are written in small letters.
    e.g.: java.io, java.lang, java.awt etc
    2. Each word of class name and interface name starts with a capital
    e.g.: Sample, AddTwoNumbers
    3. Method names start with small letters then each word start with a capital
    e.g.: sum (), sumTwoNumbers (), minValue ()
     Test Variable (We cannot include a space in an identifier)
     123javatest (The identifier should not begin with numbers)
     java+test (The plus (+) symbol cannot be used)
     a-javatest (Hyphen symbol is not allowed)
     java_&_Ttest (ampersand symbol is not allowed)
     Java'test (we cannot use an apostrophe symbol in an identifier)4. Variable names also follow the same above method rule
    e.g.: sum, count, totalCount
    5. Constants should be written using all capital letters
    e.g.: PI, COUNT
    6. Keywords are reserved words and are written in small letters.
    e.g.: int, short, float, public, void
    Variables:
     A variable is a name given to a memory location that is used to store the value.
     The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.
     In Java, all the variables must be declared before use.
    Variable Declaration:
    Variable initialization:
    Types of Variables in Java
    There are three types of variables in Java:
    1. Local Variables
    2. Instance Variables
    3. Static Variables
    1. Local Variables
     A variable defined within a block or method or constructor is called a local variable.
     The scope of these variables exists only within the block in which the variable is
    declared. i.e., we can access these variables only within that block.
     Initialization of the local variable is mandatory before using it in the defined scope.
    Example:
    class Add{
    public static void main(String[] args){
    int a=10, b=20; //Local variables
    System.out.println (a+b);
     }
    }
    2. Instance Variables
     Instance variables are non-static variables and are declared in a class outside any method,
    constructor, or block.
     As instance variables are declared in a class, these variables are created when an object of
    the class is created and destroyed when the object is destroyed.
     Use access specifier for instance variables. If we do not specify any access specifier, then
    the default access specifier will be used.
     Initialization of Instance Variable is not mandatory. Its default value is 0
     Instance Variable can be accessed only by creating objects.
    Example:
    class Add{
    int a=10, b=20; // Instance variables
    public static void main(String[] args){
    // Instance or object creation
    Add ob = new Add();
    // Accessing Instance Variable using object
    System.out.println (ob.a+ob.b);
     }
    }
    3. Static Variables
     Static variables are also known as Class variables.
     These variables are declared similarly as instance variables. The difference is that static
    variables are declared using the static keyword within a class outside any method
    constructor or block.
     Static variables are created at the start of program execution and destroyed automatically
    when execution ends.
     Initialization of Static Variable is not Mandatory. Its default value is 0
     we can access the static variable like the Instance variable (through an object).
     we can access the static variable with class name.
     we can access the static variable without class name.
    Example:
    class Add{
    static int a=10, b=20; // static variables
    public static void main(String[] args){
    // Instance or object creation
    Add ob = new Add();
    //Accessing static variables without class name
    System.out.println (a+b);
    //Accessing static variables with class name
    System.out.println(Add.a+Add.b);
    //Accessing static variables with object
    System.out.println(ob.a+ob.b);
     }
    }
    Diff b/w Instance Variables and Static Variables:
    Instance Variables:
     Instance Variables are declared without static keyword.
     They are specific to object i.e., for every object, separate memory will be allocated for
    each instance Variable.
     They can be accessed only by using the Object.
    Static Variables:
     Static Variables are declared with static keyword.
     They are also called as “Class Variables”.
     They are not specific to any object.
     The memory for static Variables will be allocated whenever the class is loaded in to the
    memory i.e., memory will be allocated only once which will be shared by all the objects of
    the class.
    Data types in Java:
     The type of value stored in a variable is called as datatype.
    Ex: int a = 20;
     char ch= „A‟;
    Data types can be classified into two types in java
    1. Primitive Data Types
    2. Non-Primitive Data Types
    Note:
    Except Boolean and char all remaining data types are considered as signed data types because we
    can represent both “+ve” and”-ve” numbers.
    1. Primitive Data Types:
     There are 8 primitive data types supported by Java.
     Primitive data types are predefined by the language and named by a key word.
    A. byte:
     Size: 1 Byte (8 bits)
     Max-value: +127
     Min-value: -128
     Range: -128 to 127 [-2
    7
    to 27
    -1]
    Example:
    byte b=10; ► ✔
    byte b2=130; ►C.E: possible loss of precision
    byte b=10.5 ►C.E: possible loss of precision
    byte b=true; ►C.E: incompatible types
    byte b="REC"; ►C.E: incompatible types
     byte data type is best suitable if we are handling data in terms of streams either from the
    file or from the network.
    B. short:
     Size: 2 Bytes
     Range: -32768 to 32767 (-2
    15 to 215
    -1)
    Example:
    short s=130; ► ✔
    short s=32768; ►C.E: possible loss of precision
    short s=true; ►C.E: incompatible types
     The most rarely used data type in java is short.
     Short data type is best suitable for 16-bit processors like 8086 but these processors are
    completely outdated and hence the corresponding short data type is also outdated data
    type.
    C. Int:
     Size: 4 bytes
     Range: -2147483648 to 2147483647 (-2
    31 to 231
    -1)
    Example:
    int i=130; ► ✔
    int i=10.5; ►C.E: possible loss of precision
    int i=true; ►C.E: incompatible types
     This is most commonly used data type in java.
    D. long:
     Size: 8 bytes
     Range: -2
    63 to 263
    -1
    Example:
    long l= 13l;
     To hold the no. Of characters present in a big file int may not enough hence the
    return type of length() method is long.
    long l=f.length() ; ►f is a file
     Whenever int is not enough to hold big values then we should go for long data type.
    Note:
    All the above data types (byte, short, int and long) can be used to represent whole numbers. If we
    want to represent real numbers then we should go for floating point data types.F. boolean data type:
     Size: Not applicable (virtual machine dependent)
     Range: Not applicable but allowed values are true or false.
    Example1:
    boolean b=true; ► ✔
    boolean b=True; ►C.E: cannot find symbol
    boolean b="True"; ►C.E: incompatible types
    boolean b=0; ►C.E: incompatible types
    Example 2:
    int x=10;
    if( x )
    System.out.println(“Hello”);
    else
    System.out.println(“HI”);
    ►Compiler error: incompatible types
    Found: int
    Require: boolean
    G. char data type:
     Size: 2 bytes
     Range: 0 to 65535
    Example:
    char ch1=97; ►✓
    char ch2=65536; ►C.E: possible loss of precision
     In java we are allowed to use any worldwide alphabets character and java is Unicode
    based to represent all these characters one byte is not enough compulsory we should go
    for 2 bytes.                                                                                                                       Operators in Java:
    Operator in Java is a symbol that is used to perform operations on variables / operands /
    constants.
    Java provides a rich set of operators to manipulate variables. We can divide all the Java operators
    into the following groups:
    1. Arithmetic Operators
    2. Relational Operators
    3. Bitwise Operators
    4. Logical Operators
    5. Assignment Operators
    6. Unary Operators
    7. Conditional Operator
    8. Misc Operators
    1. Arithmetic Operators
    Java arithmetic operators are used to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    They act as basic mathematical operations.Example
    public class Test {
     public static void main(String args[]) {
     int a = 10;
     int b = 20;
     int c = 25;
     System.out.println("a + b = " + (a + b));
     System.out.println("a - b = " + (a - b));
     System.out.println("a * b = " + (a * b));
     System.out.println("b / a = " + (b / a));
     System.out.println("b % a = " + (b % a));
     System.out.println("c % a = " + (c % a));
     }
    }
    2. Relational Operators
    Relational operators are used to check the relationship between two operands.Example
    public class Test {
     public static void main(String args[]) {
     int a = 10;
     int b = 20;
     System.out.println("a == b = " + (a == b));
     System.out.println("a != b = " + (a != b));
     System.out.println("a > b = " + (a > b));
     System.out.println("a < b = " + (a < b));
     System.out.println("b >= a = " + (b >= a));
     System.out.println("b <= a = " + (b <= a));
     }
    }
    3. Bitwise Operators
    Bitwise operators in Java are used to perform operations on individual bits.Example:
    public class Test {
     public static void main(String args[]) {
     int a = 60; /* 60 = 0011 1100 */
     int b = 13; /* 13 = 0000 1101 */
     int c = 0;
     c = a & b; /* 12 = 0000 1100 */
     System.out.println("a & b = " + c );
     c = a | b; /* 61 = 0011 1101 */
     System.out.println("a | b = " + c );
     c = a ^ b; /* 49 = 0011 0001 */
     System.out.println("a ^ b = " + c );
     c = ~a; /*-61 = 1100 0011 */
     System.out.println("~a = " + c );
     c = a << 2; /* 240 = 1111 0000 */
     System.out.println("a << 2 = " + c );
     c = a >> 2; /* 15 = 1111 */
     System.out.println("a >> 2 = " + c );
     c = a >>> 2; /* 15 = 0000 1111 */
     System.out.println("a >>> 2 = " + c );
     }
    }
    Output
    a & b = 12
    a | b = 61
    a ^ b = 49
    ~a = -61
    a << 2 = 240
    a >> 2 = 15
    a >>> 2 = 15
    4. Logical Operators:
    Logical operators are used to check whether an expression is true or false. They are used in
    decision making.Example:
    public class Test {
     public static void main(String args[]) {
     boolean a = true;
     boolean b = false;
     System.out.println("a && b = " + (a&&b));
     System.out.println("a || b = " + (a||b));
     System.out.println(“! (a && b) = " +! (a && b));
     }
    }
    5. Assignment Operators:
    Assignment operators are used in Java to assign values to variables.
    Following are the assignment operators supported by Java language.Example:
    public class Test {
     public static void main(String args[]) {
     int a = 10;
     int b = 20;
     int c = 0;
     c = a + b;
     System.out.println("c = a + b = " + c);
     c += a;
     System.out.println("c += a = " + c);
     c -= a;
     System.out.println("c -= a = " + c);
     c *= a;
     System.out.println("c *= a = " + c);
     a = 10;
     c = 15;
     c /= a;
     System.out.println("c /= a = " + c);
     a = 10;
     c = 15;
     c %= a;
     System.out.println("c %= a = " + c);
    }
    }6. Unary Operators
    In Java, the unary operator is an operator that can be used only with an operand. It is used to
    represent the positive or negative value, increment/decrement the value by 1,
    and complement a Boolean value.Example 1: Java Unary Operator Example: ++ and --
    public class OperatorExample{
    public static void main(String args[]){
    int x=10;
    System.out.println(x++);
    System.out.println(++x);
    System.out.println(x--);
    System.out.println(--x);
    }
    }
    Output
    10
    12
    12
    10
